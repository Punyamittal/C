/*Write a C program to generate Electricity bills.



If the type of the EB connection is Domestic, calculate the amount to be paid as follows:

first 100 units - Rs. 1 per unit
101-200 units - Rs. 2.50 per unit
201 -500 units - Rs. 4 per unit
> 501 units - Rs. 6 per unit


If the type of the EB connection is Commercial, calculate the amount to be paid as follows:

first 100 units - Rs. 2 per unit
101-200 units - Rs. 4.50 per unit
201 -500 units - Rs. 6 per unit
> 501 units - Rs. 7 per unit


Examples



Input:

D

150

Output:

Electricity Bill Amount: Rs. 225.00

Explanation:

For a domestic connection with 150 units consumed, the electricity bill amount would be calculated as follows:

first 100 units: Rs. 1.0 per unit = Rs. 100
next 50 units: Rs. 2.5 per unit = Rs. 125
Total amount = Rs. 100 + Rs. 125 = Rs. 225.



Input:

C

600

Output:

Electricity Bill Amount: Rs. 3150.00

Explanation:

For a commercial connection with 600 units consumed, the electricity bill amount would be calculated as follows:

first 100 units: Rs. 2.0 per unit = Rs. 200
next 100 units: Rs. 4.5 per unit = Rs. 450
next 300 units: Rs. 6.0 per unit = Rs. 1,800
remaining 100 units: Rs. 7.0 per unit = Rs. 700
Total amount = Rs. 200 + Rs. 450 + Rs. 1,800 + Rs. 700 = Rs. 3,150.*/
