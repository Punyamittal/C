/*Problem Statement



Diwan is working on a project where he needs to analyze the stability of a system based on the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. The matrix represents some system characteristics, and its determinant can be used to determine whether the system is stable or unstable.



If the determinant of the matrix is 0 or negative, the system is unstable. If the determinant is positive, the system is stable. Help Diwan to check the stability of the system.

Input format :
The program takes three lines of input. Each line contains three integers separated by spaces, representing a row of the 3x3 matrix.

Output format :
The program will first print the matrix in the specified format.

Then, the program will print the determinant of the matrix.

If the determinant value is less than 1, the system is unstable.

If the determinant value is greater than or equal to 1, the system is stable.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

The matrix is always 3x3 (3 rows and 3 columns).

Each matrix element is an integer.

There are exactly 9 integers to be entered.

0 ≤ Matrix elements ≤ 30

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1 2 3
0 4 5
1 0 6
Output 1 :
The matrix is:
 1 2 3
 0 4 5
 1 0 6

Determinant of the matrix is : 22
The system is stable
Input 2 :
3 1 4
2 5 7
6 8 9
Output 2 :
The matrix is:
 3 1 4
 2 5 7
 6 8 9

Determinant of the matrix is : -65
The system is unstable
