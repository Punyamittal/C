/*Problem Statement



Teju considers the number 3 unlucky and wishes to remove the element located at the 3rd position in an array, considering the first position in the array as position 1. 



Write a program that eliminates the element at this 3rd position and then displays the modified array.

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer n, the size of the array.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Output format :
After removing the element at the 3rd position, the output displays space-separated integer array values.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases will fall under the following constraints:

3 ≤ n ≤ 15

1 ≤ elements ≤ 1000*/
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int l;
    scanf("%d",&l);
    int arr[l];
    for(int i;i<l;i++){
        scanf("%d",&arr[i]);
    }
    int l2[l-1];
    for(int i=0;i<l;i++){
        if(i==2){
            continue;
        }
        if(i!=2){
            printf("%d ",arr[i]);
        }
    }
    
}
