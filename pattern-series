/*Consider the series given below: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987,...



Write a program to find the Nth term in this series.



This series is formed as below:

 1.term(1)=1

 2.term(2)=2

 3.term(N)=term(N-1)+term(N-2)for N>2



The value N is a positive integer that should be read from STDIN. The Nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT; other than the value of the Nth term, no other characters, strings, or messages should be written to STDOUT.



For example, if N = 15, the value of the 15th n term is 987, which is the sum of the 13th and 14th terms.

Input format :
The input consists of an integer nth term in a series.

Output format :
The output consists of an integer representing the value of the nth term in the series. Otherwise, prints "Invalid Input".

Code constraints :
You can assume that the value of n will not exceed 30.*/
